Spring Data JPA
The Spring Data repository mechanism is used to reduce the effort to implement persistence for the domain objects to the declaration of an interface per aggregate root. See ArtistRepository and AudienceRepository for example. Beyond that, using the repository abstract enables the Spring Data REST module to do its work.

Spring Data REST
We're using Spring Data REST to expose the AudienceRepository as REST resource without additional effort.
